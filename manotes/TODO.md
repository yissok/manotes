# TODO

NEXT EPISODE:
- ui options
    - change top 3 dots select
        - export
            - content
            - content & metadata
        - import (to current folder)
        - settings
    - have eye button next to top folder name to view all notes in this folder
    - keep pressed item for actions
        - NOTESONLY: note edit
            - UNENCONLY: note edit within app
        - NOTESONLY: single note view
            - UNENCONLY: single note view within app
        - delete
        - copy
        - move
        - TAGSONLY: view all notes in this folder
- tap note to view
- not enc work
    - new note from app
    - allow to tap view note
    - allow user to edit note (disallow enc edit)
- order last modified
- delete protection on folder level (you are deleting folders containing 143 notes, are you sure)
- arrows for undo redo
    - when going backin time and settling on previous version, when making new change in there, the whole downstream redo tree will be deleted, add warning popup (if you commit this change you won't be able to click redo)
- CODE QUALITY
    - minimise across code filtering queries
    - simplify RootView and ListView
- squash history
- version stuff
    - pull from icloud repo             ------at every startup and before each write action, do a pull on the version file and update if increased in the meantime         ------when pulling, you will know exactly the paths of the files you are missing because you can retrieve last version in o1 and you already have the old version in userdefaults, so loop through paths old version -> file last version
    - allow to navigate to whatever version
    - allow to keep current state of tree and forget all history

    - ~~will require new protocol accepting multiple enc strings and editing shortcut's js to list out contents~~

- re introduce note from shtct
- all add tags/notes that existed before should use new `insertTree` function, this will make things easier because all changes can be applied like an onion
- create root node if no exist
- serialise into tree string
- go through children in alphabetical order for serialisation (both here and backend)
- deserialise

WON'T DO:
- server side work (if this is going to only be an ios app, let users manage their db thus allowing app to be free)
    - if conflicts, allow for export of current local and replace with new
    - have global versioning so that client knows which branches to pull from server
    - add core data client changelog + field for each log that tells if it was uploaded or not
- allow unsafe note taking mode for user convenience (encrypted notes can't be read within the app)
